# Ecommerce Sales Dashboard using Power BI

The E-commerce Sales Dashboards project aimed to provide comprehensive insights into e-commerce sales performance through interactive and visually appealing dashboards developed using Power BI. The project focused on analyzing and monitoring key metrics such as profit, order volume, customer demographics, product performance, and sales trends. By leveraging data from the e-commerce platform, the dashboards enabled stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, identify growth opportunities, and track the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. 
"For this project, I developed a set of interactive dashboards using Power BI to analyze our e-commerce sales data. I connected to our database and extracted relevant information, including order details, customer data, and product information. Then, I created various visualizations, such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs, to represent key metrics like total revenue, profit margin, and customer lifetime value. The dashboards also included interactive features, allowing users to filter data by date, product category, customer segment, and other criteria. By using these dashboards, our marketing team was able to identify the most profitable customer segments, optimize pricing strategies, and improve campaign targeting, resulting in a significant increase in sales and customer engagement."
